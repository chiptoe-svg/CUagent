# NanoClaw FlexAgents

Multi-runtime personal assistant built on NanoClaw. Supports Claude, Codex (OpenAI), and Gemini agent SDKs.

## Scope and Non-goals

FlexAgents is based on nanoclaw v1 with multi-runtime support added in trunk. Upstream `qwibitai/nanoclaw` has since released a v2 architecture; this fork evaluated adopting it and chose not to (2026-04-18).

**Non-goals:**
- **Rebasing onto nanoclaw v2.** Session DBs, module registries, Chat SDK bridge, richer user/role schemas. Multi-runtime in trunk is this fork's primary feature and isn't improved by adopting v2. The divergence is deliberate, not a pending rebase.
- **Skill-marketplace compatibility (`/add-*` feature skills).** Divergence makes `git merge upstream/skill/*` conflict-prone; marketplace skills are reference material, not installable here. Most are channel integrations we don't need anyway.
- **Upstream's richer entity model** (users / user_roles / pending_approvals / agent_destinations). Single-user / small-team deployments don't need it.

Upstream contributions flow the other direction: provider-level work goes back as standalone PRs (e.g., the Codex app-server provider). Architecture changes stay in this fork.

For active institutional deployment (FERPA-aware, MS365-integrated, department operations), see [chiptoe-svg/CUagent](https://github.com/chiptoe-svg/CUagent) — a specialized downstream fork.

## Architecture

Four-layer system:
1. **App Shell** — channels, state, scheduling, IPC (`src/index.ts`)
2. **Runtime Boundary** — provider-neutral host adapters with `runtimeOptions` (`src/runtime/`)
3. **Runtime Setup + Container Launch** — credential resolution, provider mounts, container spawning
4. **In-Container Agent Runner** — SDK-specific agent loops with provider-driven MCP/tools/docs

All SDKs run inside the same container image. The agent-runner detects the runtime from `ContainerInput.runtime` and uses the appropriate SDK. SDKs self-register via a registry pattern (same as channels).

External services (MS365, Google Workspace, IMAP) are configured as provider JSON files — no code changes needed to add or remove a provider. Provider tokens are only mounted for authorized groups, and provider-specific usage guidance lives in provider-aware skills rather than being injected into every prompt.

## Runtime Configuration

Default runtime and model set in `.env`:
```
DEFAULT_RUNTIME=codex
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

Per-group override via `containerConfig` in the database:
```sql
UPDATE registered_groups SET container_config = '{"runtime":"claude","model":"claude-sonnet-4-6"}' WHERE jid = '...';
```

Telegram commands:
- `/model` — view/switch model for this group
- `/auth` — view/switch auth mode
- `/ping` — bot status
- `/chatid` — get chat registration ID

## Credentials

**Codex (OpenAI):** Subscription auth via `codex auth login` or API-key/env compatibility backends. Runtime setup materializes only the auth needed for the selected backend and falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` for compatible endpoints.

**Claude:** OAuth token via `claude setup-token` stored in `.env` as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Credential proxy on port 3001 injects into containers.

**Gemini:** API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey stored as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`. Free tier: 60 req/min.

## Providers

External services are configured as JSON files in `container/providers/`. On startup, defaults are copied to `~/.nanoclaw/providers/`. Each provider declares:
- Token paths (host and container mount points). `requiredFile` may be an exact name or a glob (`*.json`).
- MCP server config (or null for CLI-based providers like `gws`)
- Allowed tools (e.g., `mcp__ms365__*`)
- Init hooks (e.g., GWS credential setup)
- `containerEnv` — host env var names to forward from `.env` into the container (for BYO OAuth client credentials, API keys, etc.). In `mcp.env`, reference them with `${env.VAR_NAME}`.
- Agent docs (injected into AGENT.md at runtime)
- Auth flow (login command for `npm run provider-login`)

Shipped provider configs: `ms365` (Outlook/Calendar/Tasks), `gws` (Gmail/Drive/Calendar/Sheets/Docs via CLI), `gws_mcp` (same services via `workspace-mcp`, BYO OAuth), `imap` (placeholder). These are definitions only — run `/add-email-account` or `npm run provider-login <id>` to authenticate and activate a provider.

Provider tokens are only mounted for authorized groups (main group by default). The container-side provider registry only enables MCP servers and init hooks whose token files are actually present.

## Agent Persona (AGENT.md)

`AGENT.md` is the canonical persona file. It's runtime-agnostic.

Inside the container, the agent-runner assembles the final instructions:
- **Codex:** concatenates `global/AGENT.md` + `group/AGENT.md`, appends Codex-specific tool guidance, and passes the result to `codex app-server` as `baseInstructions`
- **Claude:** copies `AGENT.md` → `CLAUDE.md` for SDK discovery, injects global via system prompt
- **Gemini (ADK):** reads `AGENT.md` directly and parses specialist sub-agents from `## Specialists`

## Skills

Container skills in `container/skills/` are synced to `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, and `.gemini/` per group. Same SKILL.md format works with all SDKs.

## Delegation Model

Delegation stays runtime-specific by design:
- **Claude:** native team-style orchestration
- **Codex:** app-server worker threads and native delegation tools
- **Gemini:** native ADK sub-agents

The framework does not pretend these are one universal shared-session abstraction. It exposes delegation honestly as a runtime capability and keeps provider-specific orchestration inside the runtime/container layer.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
./container/build.sh # Rebuild agent container
```

Service management (macOS):
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # restart
```

## Container Build Cache

The container buildkit caches aggressively. `--no-cache` alone does NOT invalidate COPY steps. To force a truly clean rebuild, prune the builder then re-run `./container/build.sh`.

# Codex — Developer Guide

## Response style
- Be concise and direct
- Lead with the answer, not the reasoning
- Show what changed, don't explain obvious edits

## Tool usage
- Use shell commands for file operations: `cat -n` for reading, `grep -rn` for searching
- Use `apply_patch` for file editing (preferred over rewriting entire files)
- Use `find` with specific patterns for file discovery

## File reading
- Always use `cat -n` to show line numbers
- For large files, use `sed -n '10,30p' file.txt` for ranges
- When searching, use `grep -rn` to include line numbers and context

## Project memory
- Check workspace for any existing context files at session start
- No persistent memory system — each session starts fresh
- Conversation archives in `groups/*/conversations/` provide historical context
